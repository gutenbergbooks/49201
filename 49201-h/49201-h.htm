<h2>Foreword</h2>


<p>The realistic stories in this book, given for
the first time to American children, were
written in the Norwegian by JÃ¶rgen Moe and
in the Swedish by Zacharias Topelius. Both
authors have won fame in their native lands
as writers of juvenile literature. Their works
show sincere sympathy with child life and great
power to interpret it artistically.</p>

<p>Children need the realistic story side by side
with the purely imaginative fairy tale, for the
story true to human experience serves to bring
about a proper balance between the ideas
created by a world of fancy and those of the
world of reality.</p>

<p>The standard of literary merit is the same
for both kinds of stories. Both must influence
the child's life subtly and indirectly, not by
moralizing or preaching.</p>

</div><p><span class="dropletter">A</span><span class="smcap">bout</span> two hundred years ago
Finland had suffered greatly.
There had been war; cities were
burned, the harvest destroyed and thousands
of people had died; some had perished
by the sword, others from hunger,
many from dreadful diseases. There was
nothing left but tears and want, ashes
and ruins.</p>

<p>Then it happened that many families
became separated; some were captured and
carried away by the enemy, others fled to
the forests and desert places or far away
to Sweden. A wife knew nothing about
her husband, a brother nothing about his
sister, and a father and mother did not
know whether their children were living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
or dead. Some fugitives came back and
when they found their dear ones, there
was such joy that it seemed as if there
had been no war, no sorrow. Then the
huts were raised from the ashes, the fields
again turned yellow with golden harvest.
A new life began for the country.</p>

<p>During the time of the war a brother
and sister were carried far away to a foreign
land. Here they found friendly people
who took care of them. Year after
year passed and the children grew and
suffered no want. But even in their comfort
and ease they could not forget their
father, mother and native country.</p>

<p>When the news came that there was
peace in Finland, and that those who
wished might return, the children felt more
and more grieved to stay in a foreign land,
and they begged permission to return home.
The strangers who had taken care of them
laughed and said, "Foolish children, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
don't realize that your country lies hundreds
of miles away from here."</p>

<p>But the children replied, "That does
not matter, we can walk home."</p>

<p>The people then said, "Here you have
a home, clothes and food and friends who
love you; what more do you desire?"</p>

<p>"More than anything else we want to
go home," answered the children.</p>

<p>"But there is nothing but poverty and
want in your home. There you would have
to sleep on miserable moss beds and suffer
from cold and hunger. Probably your parents,
sisters, brothers and friends are dead
long ago, and if you look for them you
will find only tracks of wolves in the
snow-drifts on the lonely field where your
cottage used to stand."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the children, "but we must
go home."</p>

<p>"But you have been away from your
home for many years, you were only six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and seven years old when you were carried
away. You have forgotten the road you
came on. You can't even remember how
your parents look."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the children, "but we must
go home."</p>

<p>"Who is going to show you the way?"</p>

<p>"God will help us," answered the boy,
"and besides, I remember that a large
birch tree stands in front of my father's
cottage, and many lovely birds sing there
every morning."</p>

<p>"And I remember that a beautiful star
shines through the branches of the birch
at night," said the little girl.</p>

<p>"Foolish children," said the people in
the foreign land, "you must never think
about this again; it will only bring you
sorrow."</p>

<p>But still the children always thought
about going home, not because they were
disobedient, but because it was impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
for them to forget their country, impossible
to cease longing for father and mother.</p>

<p>One moonlight night the boy could not
sleep for the thoughts of home and parents.
He asked his sister if she were
asleep.</p>

<p>"No, I can't sleep. I am thinking of
our home."</p>

<p>"And so am I," said the boy, "come let
us pack our clothes and flee. There seems
to be a voice in my heart that says, 'Go
home, go home,' it is the voice of God I
know, so we are doing nothing wrong."</p>

<p>"Yes, let us go," said the sister. And
quietly they went away.</p>

<p>It was a lovely night, the moon shone
brightly and lit up the paths. "But dear
brother, I am afraid we never shall find
our home," said the little girl after they
had walked a while.</p>

<p>The brother answered, "Let us always
go toward the northwest, and we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
surely reach Finland, and when we are
there, the birch and the star shall be our
sign. If we see the star shining through
the leaves of the birch, we shall know
that we are at home."</p>

<p>"But don't you think wild beasts may
devour us or robbers carry us away?"
cried she.</p>

<p>"Remember, sister dear, the hymn which
our mother taught us long ago&mdash;'Though
you suffer in a foreign land, God will lead
you by the hand.'"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the little girl, "God will
send his angels to protect us in the foreign
land."</p>

<p>And they went bravely on. The boy
cut a stout stick from a young oak tree in
order to protect his sister and himself, but
no evil befell them.</p>

<p>One day they came to a cross road
where they did not know which way to go.
Then they saw two little birds that were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
singing in a tree by the road on the left-hand
side. "Come," said the brother,
"this road is the right one. I know it
from the song of the birds. Perhaps these
little birds are sent by God to help us
along."</p>

<p>The children went on, and the birds
flew from branch to branch, but not faster
than the little ones could follow them. The
children ate nuts and berries in the woods,
drank water from the clear brooks, and
slept at night on soft beds of moss. They
seemed to be cared for in a most wonderful
way. They always had enough to eat, and
they always found a place where they
could spend the night. They could not
tell why, but whenever they saw the little
birds, they said, "See, there are God's
angels, who are helping us." And so they
walked on.</p>

<p>But at last the little girl grew very tired
from wandering about so long, and said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
her brother, "When shall we begin to look
for our birch?"</p>

<p>And he answered, "Not until we hear
people speak the language which our father
and mother spoke."</p>

<p>Again they walked towards the north
and west. Summer was gone, the days in
the forests began to grow cold and again
the little sister asked about the birch, but
her brother begged her to be patient.</p>

<p>The country through which they now
wandered gradually began to change. The
land which they had left and through
which they had walked for weeks and
months was a level land, now they had
come into a country with mountains, rivers
and lakes. The little sister asked, "Tell
me brother how shall we get over the steep
mountains?"</p>

<p>Her brother answered, "I shall carry
you," and he carried her.</p>

<p>Again the little girl asked, "How shall
we cross the rapid rivers and the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
lakes?"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/image3.jpg" width="425" height="556" alt="... and he rowed across the rivers and
lakes" />
</div>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 1em;">... and he rowed across the rivers and<br />
lakes</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>The boy answered, "We shall row
across," and he rowed across the rivers and
lakes; for wherever they came, they found
boats, which seemed to be there just for
their sakes. Sometimes the brother swam
with his little sister across the rivers and
they floated easily on the waves. At their
side flew the two little birds. One evening
when they were very tired, the children
came upon the ruins of burned down
buildings. Close by stood a large new
farm house. Outside the kitchen door
stood a girl peeling vegetables. "Will you
give us something to eat?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"Yes, come," answered the child,
"mother is in the kitchen, she will give you
supper, if you are hungry."</p>

<p>Then the brother threw his arms about
his sister's neck. "Do you hear, sister?
This girl speaks the language that our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
father and mother spoke. Now we may
begin to look for the birch and the star."
The children then went into the kitchen
where they were received with much friendliness,
and were asked where they came
from. They answered, "We come from a
foreign land and are looking for our home.
We have no other mark than this&mdash;a
large birch tree grows in the yard in front
of the house. In the morning birds sing
in its branches, and in the evening a large
star shines through its leaves."</p>

<p>"Poor children," said the people, full
of pity, "thousands of birches grow in
this country, thousands of birds sing in
the tree tops, and thousands of stars shine
in the sky. How will you find your birch
and your star?"</p>

<p>The boy and girl answered, "God will
help us. His angels have led us to our
own country. Now we are almost at
home."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Finland is great," said the people,
shaking their heads.</p>

<p>"But God is greater!" answered the
boy. And they thanked the good people
for their kindness and went on their way.</p>

<p>It was fortunate for the children that
they did not need to sleep in the woods
any longer, but could go from farm to
farm. Though there were wide plains
between the human dwellings and great
poverty everywhere, the children were
given food and shelter; all felt sorry for
them.</p>

<p>But their birch and star they did not
find. From farm to farm they looked;
there were so many birches and so many
stars, but not the right ones.</p>

<p>"Finland is so large, and we are so
small," sighed the little girl, "I don't
think we will ever find our home."</p>

<p>The boy said, "Do you believe in
God?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, you know I do," she answered.</p>

<p>"Remember then," continued the
brother, "that greater miracles have been
performed. When the three wise men
journeyed to Bethlehem, a star went before
them to show them the way. God will
show us the way too."</p>

<p>"Yes, he will," answered the little girl.
She always agreed with her brother. And
bravely they trudged on.</p>

<p>One evening at the end of the month of
May, they came to a lonely farm. This
was in the second year of their wanderings.
As they approached the house, they saw
a large birch tree which stood in front of
it. The light green leaves looked lovely in
the bright summer evening and through
the leaves shone the bright evening star.
"That's our birch!" cried the boy.</p>

<p>"That is our star," whispered the little
girl.</p>

<p>Each clasped the neck of the other and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
praised the good Lord with joyful hearts.
"Here is the barn where father's horses
stood," began the boy.</p>

<p>"I am sure this is the well where mother
raised water for the cattle," answered the
girl.</p>

<p>"Here are two small crosses under the
birch. I wonder what that means," said
the boy.</p>

<p>"I am afraid to go in," said the girl.
"What if Father and Mother are not living,
or think if they don't know us. You
go in first, brother."</p>

<p>In the sitting-room sat an old man and
his wife&mdash;well, they were really not old,
but suffering and sorrow had aged them
before their time. The man said to his
wife, "Now spring has come again, birds
are singing, flowers are peeping up everywhere,
but there is no new hope of joy in
our hearts. We have lost all our children,
two are resting under the birch, and far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
sadder&mdash;two are in the land of the enemy,
and we shall never see them on earth. It is
hard to be alone when one grows old."</p>

<p>The wife answered, "I have not given
up hope. God is mighty, he led the people
of Israel out of their imprisonment. If he
so wills he has the power to give us back
our children."</p>

<p>"Oh, what a blessing that would be,"
answered the man.</p>

<p>While he was still talking, the door
opened. In stepped a boy and a girl who
asked for something to eat. "Come nearer
children," said the man, "stay with us
tonight." And to each other the old people
said, "Our children would have been
just their ages if we had been allowed to
keep them, and they would have been just
as beautiful," thought the parents, and
they wept.</p>

<p>Then the children could keep still no
longer, but embraced their father and
mother, crying, "We are your children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
whom God in a wonderful way has led back
from the foreign land."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>
<p class="center" style="margin-top: 1em;">In stepped a boy and a girl</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>The parents pressed the children to their
hearts and all praised God, who on this
lovely spring evening had brought the
warmth of joy to them.</p>

<p>And now the children had to tell everything
that had happened to them, and
though there was much sorrow and many
dark days to tell of, now the sorrow was
changed to joy. The father felt of the
arms of his son and rejoiced to find him
so manly and strong. The mother kissed
the rosy cheeks of her daughter and said,
"I knew something beautiful would happen
to-day, because two little strange birds
sang so sweetly in the top of the birch this
morning."</p>

<p>"We know those birds," said the little
girl. "They are angels disguised which
have flown before us all the way to lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
us home. They sang because they were
glad that we had found our home."</p>

<p>"Come, let us go and see the birch,"
said the boy. "Look, sister, here lie our
little brother and sister."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the mother, "but they are
now angels with God."</p>

<p>"I know, I know," cried the little girl,
"the angels in bird form who have flown
before us all the way and who sang of
our coming, are our brother and sister. It
was they who always seemed to say to us
'Go home to Father and Mother.' It was
they who cared for us, so that we did not
starve or freeze to death. It was they
who sent us boats so that we were not
drowned in the rapid rivers. It was also
they who said to us, 'That is the right
birch, this is the right star.' God sent
them to keep us safe."</p>

<p>"See," said the boy, "the star is shining
more brightly than ever through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
leaves. It is bidding us welcome. Now we
have found our home&mdash;now our wanderings
are ended."</p>

<h4>Part One</h4>

<h3><a name="doll" id="doll">The Doll under the Briar Rosebush</a></h3>


<div><img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg"
width="75" height="74" alt="T" />
</div><p><span class="dropletter">T</span><span class="smcap">here</span> was once a little girl, and
her name was Beate. She was
only five years old, but a bright
and good little girl she was.</p>

<p>On her birthday her father had given
her a beautiful straw hat. There were
red ribbons around it, I can't tell you
how pretty it was. Her mother had given
her a pair of yellow shoes and the daintiest
white dress. But her old aunt had given
her the very best present of all; it was
a doll, with a sweet pretty face and dark
brown curls. She was a perfect beauty
in every respect. There was nothing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
matter with her except that the left
eyebrow was painted a tiny bit too high up.</p>

<p>"It looks as if she were frowning a
little. I wonder if she is not quite
pleased?" asked Beate, when she held her
in her arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," answered her aunt, "but
she doesn't know you yet. It is a habit
she has of always lifting her eyebrow a
little when she looks closely at anyone.
She only wants to find out if you are a
good little girl."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, and now she knows, for now
that eyebrow is just like the other one,"
said Beate.</p>

<p>Oh, how Beate grew to love that doll,
almost more than she loved Marie and
Louise, and they were her best friends.</p>

<p>One day Beate was walking in the yard
with her doll in her arms. The doll had
a name now, and they had become fast
friends. She had called her Beate, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
own name, and the name of her old aunt
who had given her the doll.</p>

<p>It was in the early spring. There was
a beautiful green spot, with fine, soft grass
in one corner of the yard around the old
well. There stood a big willow tree with
a low trunk, and it was covered with the
little yellow blossoms that children call
goslings.</p>

<p>They look like goslings too, for each
little tassel has soft, soft yellow down,
and they can swim in the water, but walk?&mdash;no,
that they cannot do.</p>

<p>Now Big Beate&mdash;she wasn't more than
five years old, but she was ever so much
bigger than the other one&mdash;and Little
Beate, soon agreed that they would pick
goslings from the tree and throw them
into the well, so that they might have
just as good a time as the big geese and
goslings that were swimming about in the
pond. It was really Big Beate who thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of this first, but Little Beate agreed immediately;
you can't imagine how good she
always was.</p>

<p>Now Big Beate climbed up into the
willow and picked many pretty yellow
goslings into her white apron, and when
she counted them and had counted to
twenty, twice, she said that now they had
enough, and Little Beate thought so too.</p>

<p>So she began to climb down, but that
was not easy for she had to hold her
apron together with one hand and climb
with the other. She thought Little Beate
called up to her to throw the goslings
down first, but she didn't dare to do that;
she was afraid they might fall and hurt
themselves.</p>

<p>Now both of them ran over to the well,
and Big Beate helped her little friend
to get her legs firmly fixed between the
logs that were around the well, so that
she might sit in comfort and watch the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
little goslings swim about on the water.
Then gosling after gosling was dropped
down, and as soon as each one reached
the water it seemed to become alive and
it moved about. Oh, what fun! Big Beate
clapped her hands to the pretty little
downy birds, and when she helped Little
Beate a bit, she too could clap her hands.</p>

<p>But after awhile the little goslings would
not swim any longer but lay quite still.
That was no fun at all, so Big Beate
asked her namesake if she didn't think
she might lean a little over the edge of
the well and blow on them, for then she
thought they might come to life again.
Little Beate didn't answer, but she raised
her left eyebrow a good deal and moved
her right arm in the air as if she were
saying, "Please don't do that, dear Big
Beate! Don't you remember Mother has
told us how dark it is down there in the
well? Think, if you should fall in!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense; just see how easy it is,"
said Big Beate, for she thought the goslings
were stupid when they didn't want to swim
about. She leaned out over the well and
blew on the nearest ones&mdash;Yes, it helped&mdash;the
goslings began to swim again. But
those that were farthest away didn't move
at all.</p>

<p>"What stupid little things!" said Beate,
and she leaned far, far out over the edge
of the well. Then her little hands slipped
on the smooth log and&mdash;splash! in she fell
deep down into the water. It was so cold,
so icy cold, and it closed over her head and
took the straw hat, which she had got on
her birthday, off her hair. She hadn't time
to hear if Little Beate screamed, but I'm
sure she did.</p>

<p>When Beate's head came over the water
again she grasped the round log with both
her hands but the hands were too small
and the log too wide and slippery, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
couldn't hold on. Then she saw her dear
friend, Little Beate, standing stiff and
dumb with fright, staring at her and with
her right arm stretched out to her. Big
Beate hurriedly caught hold of her and
Little Beate made herself as stiff as she
could, and stiffer still, and stood there
between the logs holding her dear friend
out of the water.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 1em;">... and stood there between the logs<br />
holding her dear friend out of the water</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>Now Beate screamed so loudly that her
father and mother heard her and came
running as fast as they could, pale and
frightened, and pulled her out. She was
dripping wet and so scared and cold that
her teeth chattered.</p>

<p>The father ran to the house with her,
but she begged him for heaven's sake not
to leave Little Beate, for she might fall into
the well, "And it's she who has saved
me."</p>

<p>Now they put Beate to bed and Little
Beate had to sleep with her. When she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
had said her prayers she hugged her little
friend and said, "Never, never can I thank
you enough, because you saved me from
that horrible deep well, dear Little Beate.
Of course, I know that our Lord helped
you to stand firm between the logs, and to
make yourself so strong and stiff, but it
was you, and no one else who stretched
your hand out to me, so that I was not
drowned. And therefore you shall be my
very best friend, always, and when I grow
up you shall be the godmother to my first
daughter, and I shall call her Little Beate
for you." Then she kissed the little one
and slept.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>




<h4>Part Two</h4>

<h3><a name="vigo" id="vigo">Viggo</a></h3>


<p>Now Big Beate had a brother who was
bigger still than she. He was eight years
old, and he was a wild, mischievous boy.
His name was really only Viggo, but he
had read an old story about a terrible,
bearded viking by the same name, who
sailed from land to land killing and robbing
and bringing with him on his ship all the
gold and silver which he found and all
the pretty girls. So Viggo got a hatchet,
just such a one as he had read that the old
Viking had, and he told his sister that after
this she must call him Viggo the Viking,
for a Viking he would be when he grew up.
In the yard he ran after the chickens and
the ducks; he wanted to try his strength
and the ax on their heads. They cackled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and screamed and flew away from him and
this only made the little viking the braver.
But when he came to the geese, with
uplifted ax, shouting his wild war cry, the
old gander got angry, bent his long neck
and pinched Viggo the Viking's leg so that
he threw his ax down and ran screaming
and howling away. The old gander knew
well enough the code of the vikings, that
vikings are not allowed to rob and kill in
their own country, no not even on the
other side of the goose pond.</p>

<p>One day Viggo the Viking came up to
his sister. He looked wild, wore a big
paper helmet on his head and frowned
angrily.</p>

<p>"Now I am going to carry away the
pretty girls in this land, that is what I
have come for," said he. "You are too
big, but Little Beate is surely going to be
mine. I'll carry her far, far away, at least
to the pine woods and perhaps even to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
pasture, and you shall never see her any
more, in all your life."</p>

<p>"You are a naughty boy, and give us
nothing but trouble, that is what Mother
said too, the other day," said Beate.
"Little Beate has done you no harm, she
hasn't even said a word to you."</p>

<p>"Has not done anything to me?" said
the viking. "Didn't she stand on the
flower pot yesterday under the big geranium,
when I came and put my horse
there? Don't you think I saw that she
pushed my horse so that he fell down and
broke his left hind leg? If I did what she
deserves, I should cut her head off," said
the viking, and he tried the edge of his
little ax with his fingers.</p>

<p>"Oh! you are a terrible boy," said Beate,
"but I know well how to hide Little
Beate, so that you shall never touch her."</p>

<p>Then she went straight to her little
friend and told her sorrowfully what a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
naughty boy Viggo was, that he intended
to kill her, and that she, Big Beate, didn't
dare to have her inside the house. "But
I know a place where I shall hide you well
so that he shall never find you," said she.</p>

<p>Then she took her little friend and went
with her behind the barn to a high stone
fence. Close up against it stood a briar
rose bush laden with blossoms, the pale
pink roses hanging down on all sides. It
made a little fragrant bower and there
Little Beate should stay in its shade and
shelter and sit on a grass bench. When
night came, and it grew damp and cold,
she should not be uncomfortable for she
had her warm cape there, and raisin
cookies she had on a platter by her side,
and all about her the roses bloomed so
prettily.</p>

<p>Then Big Beate kissed her good-bye and
good-night, and begged her to be patient,
and by no means to go out so that Viggo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the Viking should see her. Big Beate
promised surely to see her the next morning
and find out how she had slept, and
then she went quietly away.</p>

<p>Beate had hardly time to wash her face
the next morning before she ran to her
little friend. She was afraid that Little
Beate might have been scared in the dark,
because she was all alone in the little
bower during the night. Beate ran as
fast as she could and came out of breath
to the briar rose bush. But you can't
imagine her sorrow. Little Beate was not
there, her cape and hat lay on the ground,
but her little friend was gone. Nowhere
was she to be found. Beate searched and
called her name, but no answer came. It
was Viggo the Viking who had carried her
away, she knew. As sorrowful as she now
was, Big Beate had never been before in
all her life. She burst into tears and
turned home slowly with a broken heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Who should after this be her best friend,
who always was willing to do what she
wanted? And who should be godmother
to her first daughter when she grew up?</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>




<h4>Part Three</h4>

<h3><a name="floating" id="floating">The Floating Island</a></h3>


<p>Beate was now a year older. During
that year she had never forgotten Little
Beate. She had looked for her in the
orchard and far away in the pasture.</p>

<p>When Mother had asked Viggo about
Little Beate he answered that the country
was full of vikings and wild beasts, and
that he did not know anything about the
doll.</p>

<p>Big Beate had many dolls given to her,
but not one was like Little Beate. No one
was so sweet and good natured, no one
so pretty and graceful.</p>

<p>Either the dolls had cheeks that were
too red or they could not be dressed right&mdash;stiff
and clumsy they all were when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
tried to move their arms and legs, and
it was no use at all to talk to them.</p>

<p>Beate had a beautiful play house with
a table and chairs and a bureau in one
corner.</p>

<p>It was a Saturday, and the next day,
Sunday, she expected her friends, Marie
and Louise, on a visit, for it was her
birthday; therefore she wanted to decorate
her doll house as prettily as she could. All
the furniture was placed just right, and
she had strewn fresh leaves on the floor,
but she needed some pretty little ornaments
for her bureau.</p>

<p>Beate knew what to do. On the hillside
by the Black Pond she remembered
that she had seen the prettiest little snail
shells anyone might wish for, round and
fluted with yellow and brown markings.
They would be just the thing for the
bureau, if she could only find empty ones.
She ran off to search for them, slipping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
in and out through the hazel bushes, and
creeping in under the mountain ashes and
junipers on the steep hillside, and picking
empty snail shells by the dozen.</p>

<p>But all of a sudden she heard a bird
cry such a weird cry from the lake. She
peeped out between the green branches
and saw a big, big bird swimming about
down there; it had a long blue neck and
a white breast, but its back was shining
black. It swam over the lake so fast
that you could see a streak in the water
behind it, and then suddenly it dived and
was gone.</p>

<p>Beate stood there and stared at the
water, waiting to see it come up again,
but she waited and she waited and no bird
came. She began to be frightened, thinking
the poor bird was drowned, when she
saw it shoot up again far away almost in
the middle of the lake.</p>

<p>It flapped its wings, making round rings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
about itself, which spread farther and farther
over the dark surface of the water.
Then it began to swim again very slowly
towards a tiny green island which lay
there. When it came to the island it
stretched its neck and looked carefully
around to all sides. Then it crept up into
the high weeds and grasses which hung
out over the water.</p>

<p>Beate could not get tired of looking at
the pretty little island. It was so pretty
and so little, not bigger than one-quarter
of the parlor floor, and oblong, with here
and there tiny bays and points. Willow
bushes grew out of the grass in some
places and in one end grew a little white-barked
birch tree. Beate thought she had
never seen anything half so lovely as the
little green island on the black water.
It seemed just like a strange little land, all
by itself. She kept watching it through
the bushes hoping all the time the bird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
would come again, but it stayed on the
island.</p>

<p>At last the evening breeze began to
ruffle the surface of the water a little and
Beate remembered that she must hurry
home. She bent down to pick a few more
snail shells which she might give to Marie
and Louise. Again she looked up and
peeped through the leaves and branches
to say good-night to the island, when&mdash;think
of it! The little green island was
gone.</p>

<p>Beate wouldn't believe her own eyes, she
thought she must have moved without
knowing it, so that the bushes hid the
island from her, but no, she was sitting
exactly in the same spot.</p>

<p>She thought of goblins and fairies and
ran up the path to the top of the hill as
fast as she could. But when she got there
she had to look again. And she became
more astonished than ever for now she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
saw the little green island again but far
from the place where she first saw it. It
was sailing slowly towards the southern
end of the lake and the silver birch was
its sail.</p>

<p>As soon as Beate reached home she found
Anne, the nurse, and told her what she
had seen.</p>

<p>Anne knew all about the floating island,
it had been on the lake for many years,
she said. But there were many strange
things about it. Every time there was to
be a fine year for the farmers the island
was green all summer, but if there was to
be a bad year the grass on it grew yellow
and brown and there were but few leaves
on the little birch. Yes, old Anne would
not be surprised if there appeared blood
red spots on the island in years of warfare
and trouble.</p>

<p>Every year there was a loon's nest there,
and Anne had her own opinions both of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the loon and the island; but when Beate
wanted to know more, old Anne only shook
her head, for she was not the kind that
told everything she knew.</p>

<p>But one thing she would tell and that
was, that if anyone stood on the floating
island and took a loon's egg out of the
nest and wished for something, that wish
would come true, if the egg was put safely
back into the nest again. If you wished
to become the Princess of England your
wish would indeed be fulfilled, said old
Anne. But there was one more thing to
notice; you must not talk about it to a
living soul.</p>

<p>"Not even to Father and Mother?"
asked Beate.</p>

<p>"No," said Anne, "not to a living soul."</p>

<p>Beate could think of nothing but the
island all that evening, and when she had
closed her eyes she could dream of nothing
else all night. Now it was covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
blood-red spots&mdash;now it was green; then
she thought that the loon cried "I am
the Princess of England, but I have been
bewitched and must stay a loon."</p>

<p>Just as soon as Beate got up in the
morning she begged her father to row her
and Marie and Louise out to the floating
island, when they came to visit her in
the afternoon, and that he promised.</p>

<p>But he also asked how she had happened
to think of that and what she wanted
there. Beate thought first that she would
tell him everything, but then she remembered
Anne's words and only said that
she wished to go out there because the
little green island was so pretty, and she
wished to look at it more closely.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, it is pretty and you shall
see a loon's nest too," said the father
stroking Beate's brown hair.</p>

<p>Then Beate's face grew red and the
tears came to her eyes, for she knew well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
enough about the loon's nest and about
the eggs.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the father took the
three little girls down to the lake. Viggo
was along too, but there was no boat, only
a raft, not large enough to carry all of
them, so he had to stay behind. And he
was perfectly willing for he was now older
and had grown more thoughtful than when
we last heard of him. Now he helped the
little girls on the raft.</p>

<p>The water was like a mirror, black and
shining. The big pine forest on one shore
and the green hillside on the other stood
on their heads and looked at themselves
in the smooth surface. Round about, close
to the water's edge, stood the tall grasses
high and straight, like regiments of soldiers
guarding the quiet little lake. And
here and there lay broad green leaves and
large snowy water-lilies swimming on the
dark water. Beate's friends thought this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
was the loveliest thing they had ever seen,
and they begged the father to stop and
get some of the pretty water-lilies for
them. But Beate alone was longing for
the floating island.</p>

<p>It lay in the middle of the lake, and
when they drew near, it looked as if there
were two little islands, one on top of the
water and one below its surface, and the
latter was almost prettier than the former.
The father rowed close up to the island
and around it, and when he came to the
other side the loon plunged out of the
reeds into the water and was gone.</p>

<p>"There is the loon's nest," said the
father and landed the raft.</p>

<p>The little girls leaned over the edge
while the father held them, first one,
then the other. What joy! The loon's
nest lay on the very edge of the little
tiny island hidden among the grasses, and
in the nest lay two big grayish-brown eggs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
with black spots, larger than any goose
eggs.</p>

<p>Marie and Louise shouted and laughed,
but Beate felt strangely frightened and
was very quiet. She begged her father
to let her stand on the island, only a minute,
and would he let her take one of the
eggs in her hand?</p>

<p>The father would not deny her that, but
lifted her up onto the floating island. But
he told her she must be very careful, just
lift the egg gently between her two fingers
for if the bird noticed that the egg had
been touched she would not hatch it.</p>

<p>And now Beate stood on the green floating
island. She grew quite pale, she was
so excited when she bent down to pick up
the grayish-brown egg. She lifted it carefully
between her two fingers. Now she
might wish for anything in the wide, wide
world. And what do you think she wished
for? To become the Princess of England?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Oh, no, she knew something far better than
that. Then her lips moved softly and she
whispered to herself, "And now I wish
that Little Beate was with me once more
and would never, never leave me."</p>

<p>Carefully and with trembling hand, she
put the egg back into the nest. What was
the pink something her eye caught sight
of among the tall reeds close to the nest?
It was her doll. Beate gave one shriek of
joy&mdash;"Little Beate, my own Little
Beate," she sobbed when she had her own
dearest friend in her arms again. She covered
her with tears and kisses, she held
her tight in her arms as if she would never
in the world let her go.</p>

<p>Her father, Marie, and Louise stood by
without saying a word. At last the father
stroked Beate's hair, kissed his little girl,
and lifted her on to the raft again.</p>

<p>Such a birthday party as Beate had now
she never had before nor since. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
did it matter that a year's rains and snows
had faded the pink of Little Beate's cheeks
and bleached her brown curls? She was
the guest of honor and sat on the prettiest
chair. She had all the cookies and chocolate
that she wanted. She was petted
and loved, and at night, tired and happy
Big Beate slept with her little friend in
her arms.</p>

<h4>Part Four</h4>

<h3><a name="hans" id="hans">Hans, the Old Soldier</a></h3>


<p>Viggo was ten years old now. He no
longer cared to become a viking when he
grew up. To be an officer in the army
was his one thought now; he would prefer
to become a general of course, but if
he couldn't be that at once, he would be
satisfied to be a captain; he might become
a general later. From whom do you suppose
he had learned such things? From
Hans, the old Grenadier.</p>

<p>Hans was Viggo's dearest friend, though
he was cross and curt to other people. The
servants on the farm often called the old
Grenadier "Hans the Watchdog," for
they said when he talked to anyone it
sounded like a dog barking, and he looked
as though he were ready to bite. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Viggo had once said that the Grenadier's
voice sounded like the rattle of a drum,
and the old soldier thought that was well
said. It was really from that time on that
Viggo and Hans were such good friends.</p>

<p>Hans the Grenadier was six feet-two,
and a little more. He was broad shouldered
and straight as a stick. His hair was
long and snowy white, and it hung in a
braid down his red soldier's coat.</p>

<p>When he came walking up to the farm
from his little cottage he always carried
the ax on the left shoulder, like a gun,
and marched stiff and straight turning
the toes well out, and kept step as if the
sergeant was marching right at his heels,
commanding "Left, right! Left, right!"</p>

<p>Hans wore yellow leather trousers, but
suspenders he never used, so there was
always a gap of three or four inches
between the coat and the trousers where
his shirt showed through, winter as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
as summer. His hat was worn to a reddish-brown.
It was wide at the crown and
narrow at the brim, and there was a deep
hollow in the top which filled with water
when it rained. He always wore his hat
a little on one ear. When Hans turned
his toes out more than usual and put his
hat too much on one side, the servants
would say, "Both Hans the Watchdog and
his goose pond are pretty well filled up
to-day." And however much he disliked
to, Viggo had to admit that this was a
bad sign, for Hans had the sad fault of
sometimes drinking a drop too much. But
Viggo always knew that at such times Old
Hans was most willing to tell about the
time he served in the army, both in '88
and '89. Then he told of the battles at
Kvistrum and at Lier, and first and last
about the "Prince of Gustenberg"&mdash;it
was Prince Christian of Augustenburg he
meant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"That was a man!" said Hans. "Such
a face you never saw on any man. When
he looked at you it was as if he would
eat you in one bite. And such a nose
between the eyes! You are looking at me,
well, for a common soldier I have been
specially well favored. But the Prince of
Gustenberg he had a nose that shouted
'Get out of my way.' And therefore they
did get out of his way too, wherever he
showed himself. Such another man we've
never had in Norway, neither before nor
since his time. God bless him where he
lies, and God punish those who laid him
there!"</p>

<p>"Aren't you ashamed? The Prince of
Augustenburg never swore, I'm sure," said
Viggo.</p>

<p>"You think so, you little cub? But it
is true, he never did," said Hans. "But
that is because a general does not need
to, it does not become him, but for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
common man it is just as necessary as to
drink whiskey."</p>

<p>This did not prove anything to Viggo,
on the contrary he said it was a shame to
do either.</p>

<p>"A shame?" said the Grenadier. "Do
you know what the Prince of Gustenberg
said when he spoke in front of the troops?
'One thing is a shame,' said he, 'and that
is to turn your back before retreat is
called.' And now you know what is a
shame, my boy!"</p>

<p>Viggo understood well enough that it
was no use to discuss such a matter with the
old Grenadier, so he sat silent a little
while.</p>

<p>"Have you never known a little boy
to become a general?" he asked at last.
"No, I haven't but I have known a drummer
boy who became a sergeant. He was
not much bigger than you; but that was
a lively youngster! He could do everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
you can think of. He could beat
the drum equally well standing on his
head or on his legs. There was one thing
though that was very hard for him to do
and that was to beat 'Retreat.' On the
drill ground he knew it as well as his
A-B-C's, but when he smelled the enemy's
powder he seemed to forget all about it.
The captain had to give him a rap or two
before he could remember it again. But
'Forward March' he knew how to drum,
he never forgot that, and sometimes he
beat that instead of 'Retreat,' and when
the captain got angry he made the excuse
that he did not hear, the guns made so
much noise about him, he said. Usually
he wasn't punished either, because he
had once saved the captain's life with a
snowball."</p>

<p>"With a snowball?" said Viggo.</p>

<p>"Yes, I said snowball, you little cub,
he did not use greater means. We were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
rushing up a hill with the enemy in front
of us. It was in winter, with deep snow
and thawing too. The captain and the
drummer boy led the march, eight or ten
steps in front of us. But as soon as they
came to the top of the hill there stood the
enemy in line. 'Aim!' commanded the
enemy's officer and all the guns pointed
right at the captain. Quick as lightning
the drummer boy grabbed a handful of
snow and made a snowball and, just as
the blue-jacketed donkey opened his mouth
to say 'Fire!' the drummer boy threw
the snowball straight into the open mouth.
He was speechless for a moment and stood
there mouth wide open. Well then the rest
of us arrived and we had a hot fight."</p>

<p>"Then was he made a sergeant?"
asked Viggo.</p>

<p>"Yes, a while afterwards, when the
Prince had heard of it. He was given the
rank of a sergeant, and something better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
even than that. The Prince called him
'my son.' The Prince rode to the front.
'My son,' he said to the drummer boy,
'I understand you know how to stop the
mouth of the enemy when he is about to
talk too loudly. We will try what more
you can do,' said he, and then the drummer
became sergeant."</p>

<p>"It was too bad that they didn't make
him a general," said Viggo. He stood there
polishing his coat button, then he added
half aloud, "Do you think I might become
a general, Hans?"</p>

<p>"Well, well, listen to the spring
chicken!" said Hans. "So it is general
you want to be, cub that you are? Never
mind, don't blush for that, it wasn't a bad
question. But it is very difficult, for then
you must learn much, oh very much."</p>

<p>"Mathematics, you mean?" said Viggo.
"I have learned some of that already, and
languages too."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, that is well enough, but you must
learn much more, you must learn the commands
and what is more, boy! you must
learn to drill so that you don't make a
mistake in a single movement; the gun
must dance in your hands, and when you
strike it it must sing like the dean in
church when he sings 'Amen.' And you
must march so stiff and straight that the
balls fly past you, as soon as they see you."</p>

<p>Viggo did not know when he should
learn all this, but Old Hans said that those
things one learned in war.</p>

<p>"But if only war broke out again," said
Viggo.</p>

<p>"Yes, you are right, my boy, if only war
broke out! that was well said," agreed the
Grenadier.</p>

<p>"Then do you think I might become a
general?" continued Viggo.</p>

<p>"Who knows? But it is difficult. The
eyes are not bad, you have the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
expression. But the nose, no it has not
the correct shape. But of course it may
grow and curve in time," said Old Hans.</p>

<p>And that Viggo hoped too, and in that
hope he learned to drill and march from
his old friend, but he often looked in the
mirror and wished with all his heart that
the nose would curve a little more.</p>

<h4>Part Five</h4>

<h3><a name="allarm" id="allarm">Allarm</a></h3>


<p>One afternoon Viggo was walking home
from school with a bag of books on his
back. He marched straight as a stick with
a soldierly step, for he was thinking of
the time when he should change this bag
for one full of cartridges. Old Hans was
standing outside the cottage waiting for
him, and when Viggo halted and saluted,
the old man asked if he could guess what
present there was for him at the house.</p>

<p>"How does it look?" asked Viggo.</p>

<p>"It is brown," said Hans. "Now
guess."</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose it is nothing but a lump
of brown sugar from Aunt Beate. She
never remembers that I have outgrown
such sweet stuff," said Viggo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Try again!" said Hans, and grinned.
"It is dark brown, man, it walks on four
feet and laps milk."</p>

<p>"Are you mad? Is it the puppy the
Captain has promised me? Is it?" cried
Viggo, and forgot all about standing
straight and stiff before the Grenadier.</p>

<p>"Right about, you cheater! Of course
that's what it is," said Hans the
Grenadier.</p>

<p>But Viggo turned a somersault instead
of "Right about" and ran to the house.
On a piece of carpet close by the fireplace
lay the little puppy, and he was beautiful.
Viggo could not get tired of looking at him.
The body was dark brown, but the nose
and paws were light brown, and he had a
light brown spot over each eye. He was
almost as broad as he was long, and when
Viggo sat down on the floor beside him
and stroked and patted the soft fur he
bent his short, stubby neck and smelled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and then licked Viggo's hand. Soon they
had become acquainted and from that
time on Viggo watched carefully to see if
the puppy grew, almost as carefully as
he watched his own nose, to see if it had
the proper curve so that he might become
a general.</p>

<p>But it went much faster with the puppy.
And as he grew Viggo loved him more
and more; they were inseparable. In the
night Allarm lay by his bed, and in the
daytime he sat beside Viggo when he was
studying his lessons. The puppy looked
at him with his big brown eyes, just as if
he would help him when he came to difficult
passages, and then he followed him
wherever Viggo went or stood. He was
not allowed to go along to school, but he
met him every afternoon more than half
way and barked with joy and wagged his
tail when he saw Viggo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>One winter morning Hans the Grenadier
and some of the farm hands were
going to the woods to haul lumber. Viggo
had a holiday that day so he was allowed
to go along. He put his rubber boots on
and whistled for Allarm. The puppy
jumped and barked when he noticed that
they were off for the woods, for Allarm's
father was a hound, so Allarm wanted to
hunt too. But Viggo's father said it would
be best to leave Allarm at home, for there
were packs of wolves in the woods and
their tracks had been seen even in the
field close to the farm. Viggo did not
like to leave Allarm behind, but when his
father said so of course he must do it. He
took the strap and tied Allarm to the leg
of the sofa. Then he put his old coat
on the floor beside the dog, so that he
might rest more softly and be comfortable.
But you can't imagine how Allarm whined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and howled when he understood that he
was to be left tied up instead of being
allowed to go along to the woods.</p>

<p>He lay flat on the floor and dragged his
body to Viggo's feet as far as the strap
reached&mdash;just as if he begged for freedom
and permission to go with him, and
he looked at Viggo with sad eyes which
seemed to say, "Have you really the heart
to go to the woods to have a good time,
and to leave me behind, tied up and
alone?" No, Viggo had not the heart to
do that. He told his father that he could
not stand to have Allarm so sad, happen
what would, and he begged that he might
take him along.</p>

<p>The father smiled and said he was afraid
it might be the death of his dog, but if
Viggo wanted to risk it and take him along
he must take good care of him and not
let him out of his sight. Then they untied
him, and you may imagine Allarm's joy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
he jumped and barked so that the mother
had to put her fingers in her ears.</p>

<p>How beautiful the forest was! First they
drove for awhile along the main road where
there was good driving. The seven horses
went in a line, one after the other and
Hans the Grenadier and Viggo and Allarm
walked behind the first one. On both sides
of the road stood tall pines with their yellow
trunks reaching out of the snow.
Here and there between them stood an old
fir with its branches hanging down to the
ground. The needles couldn't be seen at
all as it was white with snow from top to
bottom&mdash;there you could see its dark
brown leg. And all the young trees on
both sides stood bent to the ground under
the weight of the snow. It looked as if
they had dressed in heavy white robes
against the cold and stood there bowing
to all who went past. But they made no
loud greetings. No, the forest was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
still, so still you could not hear the least
sound except the horses' hoofs crunching
in the snow. Here and there Viggo saw
the foot-prints of a wolf beside the road.
Then he always told Allarm to keep close
by him, and that he did.</p>

<p>But after awhile they left the road and
turned into the thick forest. Hans the
Grenadier waded in front and the snow
came to his knees, then came the horses
and the boys, one after the other, and at
last Viggo. It was a fine tramp. The
snow came sifting down from twigs and
boughs, so the men were white like snowmen,
and the steam rose in clouds from
the horses because the snow melted on
them.</p>

<p>After a while they came to the logs and
began to hitch them to the horses. Then
suddenly Viggo remembered Allarm; he
had forgotten all about the dog since they
turned away from the road. He looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
around him, and just then he heard Allarm
whine and howl somewhere in the depths
of the forest.</p>

<p>As quick as lightning he grabbed an
ax which Old Hans had hewed into the
stump of a tree and rushed in through
the trees in the direction from which the
howling came. It was not easy, he ran
over the wild fields, and the snow reached
far above his knees, but he noticed nothing,
he only feared he would be too late. Once
he had to stop a little to draw breath, then
again he heard the pitiful wail of the dog,
but now it sounded fainter. Off Viggo
rushed again, and at last he spied something
between the trees. He did not see
his dog, but three wolves stood in a circle,
heads turned toward the center, the fourth
one lay inside the ring and bit something
in the snow.</p>

<p>Viggo shouted so that it thundered in
the forest, and rushed against the wolves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
with lifted ax. When he came within
seven or eight feet distance from them, the
greylegs got frightened and sneaked, tail
between the legs, far into the dark forest,
but the fourth one, who lay on top of
Allarm, hated to give up his prey. It
was a large yellow wolf. He looked up
at Viggo and showed his bloody teeth.
But Viggo only thought of the dog's danger.
"Let go of Allarm. Let go of my
dog or I'll teach you!" he cried and swung
the axe high above his head. Then greylegs
thought he had better not try the
game and sneaked slowly away after the
others. He turned once and howled and
showed his teeth, and then he disappeared
between the white bushes.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">

</div>
<p class="center" style="margin-top: 1em;">&quot;Let go of my dog or I'll teach you!&quot;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>Far down in a hole in the snow lay
Allarm. He was so bitten that he could
not jump to his feet and, when Viggo
lifted him, the blood dripped down on the
white snow. His whole body shivered and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
shook like an aspen leaf, but he licked Viggo's
hand.</p>

<p>Just then Old Hans the Grenadier stood
by Viggo's side. When he had gained his
breath after his hurried run, the old man
cried very angrily, "If I did what you
deserve I should have to whip you, you
little cub. Shame on you! Do you think
it fit for a youngster like you to rush
against a pack of wolves? If they had
eaten you up alive before you had a chance
to make a sound, what would you have
said then?"</p>

<p>"Then I would have said, 'One thing
is a shame, and that is to turn your back
before "retreat" is called,'" said Viggo,
and looked sharply at the Grenadier.</p>

<p>"Well said, my boy! The nose has not
quite the right curve yet, but the eyes are
there, and I do believe the heart too," said
Old Hans. He took the dog from Viggo
and went home with both of them.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>




<h4>Part Six</h4>

<h3><a name="black" id="black">The Black Pond</a></h3>


<p>"Hurrah, the Black Pond is frozen. The
ice is more than an inch thick, and there's
a crowd of boys down there!" shouted one
of Viggo's classmates one Sunday morning,
as he thrust his frost covered head through
the door and swung his skates. I dare
say it didn't take Viggo long before he
got his skates down from the nail, and
as soon as he had got permission from his
father, he ran off with his friend. And
what do you think, he was so anxious to
get down to the lake, that he forgot to
whistle for Allarm.</p>

<p>But Allarm had a fine nose. Just as
soon as he had swallowed his breakfast
he understood that Viggo was gone. Then
he ran out switching his tail and hunting
through the yard for Viggo's trail, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
when he noticed that it didn't lead to the
school he knew he might follow. Then he
rushed madly after him over the fields,
and had caught up with him long before
Viggo had reached the cottage of Hans
the Grenadier, which lay close by the lake.</p>

<p>One thing Viggo had promised his
father before he got permission to go,
and that was that he should be very careful
and not skate far out from the shore.
His father knew that the ice was safe along
the shore, but that near the middle of the
lake there was an air hole through which
warm air rose to the surface, and there
the ice was never thick.</p>

<p>And Viggo meant honestly to do what his
father had told him, but now you shall
hear what happened.</p>

<p>When he came to the lake there was a
crowd of boys there, big ones and little
ones, from all the farms and cottages round
about. There must have been twenty or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
more. Most of them had skates on but
some only slid on the ice. And Viggo could
see that they had been in just as great
hurry as he to get down on the ice, for
some had run off without caps and some
without mittens, but they did not notice
the cold. They shouted and laughed so
that you could not hear yourself think.</p>

<p>As soon as Viggo had put on his skates
he began to look around in the crowd.
Most of the boys he knew, for he had
raced with them before and knew he could
beat every one of them. But there was
one boy who skated about by himself and
seemed not to care about the others. He
was much bigger than Viggo, almost half
grown, and Viggo saw immediately that it
would not be easy to beat him in a race.
The boys called him Peter Lightfoot and
the name fitted him. Peter crossed his
arms and swung around on one leg. He
could do the corkscrew, skate backwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
as easily as forwards, and lie so low and
near the ice that he might have kissed it.
And this he did as easily and neatly as
one turns around on the parlor floor. But
all this Viggo could do too.</p>

<p>"Can you write your initials?" asked
Viggo. Yes, Peter Lightfoot stood on one
leg and wrote <i><b>PL</b></i> in the ice, but the letters
hung together. Then Viggo started. He
ran, turned himself around backwards and
wrote <i><b>P L</b></i> and between the P and the L
he made a short jump so that the letters
stood apart.</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Viggo! He wrote Peter
Lightfoot backwards," shouted the boys
and threw up their caps. Then the big
boy blushed crimson, but he said nothing
and tried to laugh.</p>

<p>Now they began to play "Fox and
Geese," and everybody wanted Viggo to
be the fox. Peter wanted to play too, for
he was sure that Viggo could not catch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
him; he was indeed much bigger and
stronger. The race course was scratched
in the ice and Viggo called, "Out, out,
my geese," and off they ran. But Viggo
didn't care to run after the little goslings,
it was the big gander, Peter Lightfoot, he
wished to catch. And that was a game!
Off they went, Peter in front and Viggo
after him, so that the wind whistled around
them, back and forth in corners and circles,
and all the other boys stopped and looked
on. Every time Viggo was right at his
heels, Peter jumped and was far ahead
of the fox again. But at last Viggo had
him cornered, but just as he would have
caught the goose, Peter stretched out his
left leg and meant to trip Viggo, but his
skate caught in a frozen twig and&mdash;thump!
there lay Peter Lightfoot, the ice
cracking all around him.</p>

<p>"A good thing he wasn't made of glass,"
laughed the boys and crowded around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Peter. He got up and looked angrily
around the circle of boys.</p>

<p>"Now stand in a row, we'll jump," said
he, and the boys did. They piled hats
and caps on top of each other, first only
three high. The whole row jumped that,
then four, then five, then six, but each
time fewer got over and those who pushed
the top cap off with their skates had to
stop playing and must stand aside and
look on. At last there were eight hats and
caps on top of each other, and now only
Peter and Viggo were left to jump.</p>

<p>"Put your cap on top!" said Peter,
and Viggo did. But all the boys called
and shouted, one louder than the other,
that no one could ever make that jump.</p>

<p>Now Peter came so fast that the air
whistled about him, jumped&mdash;and whiff!
he was over! He touched Viggo's cap the
least little bit, but it did not fall off the
pile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hurrah for Peter! That was a masterly
jump!" shouted the boys. "Viggo
can never do that, he is too small," said
one. Allarm seemed to be of the same
opinion; he whined and cried and ran in
front of Viggo's legs as if he wanted to
hinder him. Viggo knew this was the test,
and his heart beat fast. He chased the
dog away roughly and ran with all his
might. Just as he came running fast as
the wind ready for the jump Peter called
suddenly "Stop, Stop," but Viggo was
not the one to be confused at that; he flew
over like a bird and there was at least
four inches between his skates and the topmost
cap. Then the boys crowded around
him and shouted that Viggo was the champion;
there wasn't a boy who could come
up to him. But Peter Lightfoot looked
at him with a sly and evil eye, and you
could see he was planning to play a trick
on him. And indeed, that's what he did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>After a little while Peter took an apple
out of his pocket and rolled it over the
ice toward the airhole. "The one who
dares go for the apple may keep it!" he
called. And many dared to try that, for
the apple had not rolled far and the ice
was strong enough. Now Peter threw an
apple farther out, someone got that too.
But at last he rolled one that stopped right
on the edge of the open water. One boy
after the other ran out toward it, but when
the ice began to crack they slowly turned
around again.</p>

<p>"Don't do it, it is dangerous!" shouted
Viggo.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Viggo is great when things
are easy, but if there is danger he turns
pale as a ghost," said Peter and laughed
aloud.</p>

<p>This was more than Viggo could bear.
He thought of what the Prince of Augustenburg
had said before the front, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
thought he must fetch the apple, come
what might. But he forgot that "retreat"
had been called, for his father had forbidden
him to go near the hole. Allarm
looked at him with grave eyes and wagged
his tail slowly, he did not dare to whine,
for he had just been scolded. But that
did not help. Viggo ran so that the wind
whistled about his ears, and when he had
gotten out over the ice some distance he
made himself light and let the skates glide
of themselves so that he should not fall
through. The ice bent under his feet and
cracked, but he glided on and on, and the
ice did not break. Now he was close by
the apple, he bent down to pick it up&mdash;crash!
the ice broke, and Viggo, head first,
fell in.</p>

<p>In a minute Viggo's cap floated up by
the edge of the ice. Viggo seemed to have
lost consciousness in the icy water, but it
was not long before his head appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
above the hole. He swam for the ice and
seized the edge, but a piece broke off
every time he tried to climb up.</p>

<p>At first the boys stood there dumb with
fright. Then they all called to him that
he must try to hold on, but no one dared
to help him and no one thought of running
for help. Peter Lightfoot had sneaked
away when Viggo fell in.</p>

<p>The best one of them all was Allarm.
First he ran yelping around the hole, but
when he saw Viggo appear again he
snatched his wet cap between his teeth
and as fast as an arrow he ran towards
home. When he reached the cottage of
Hans the Grenadier the old soldier was
just standing in the open doorway. The
dog put Viggo's stiff frozen cap at his
feet, whined and cried, jumped up on the
old man, held on to his coat and dragged
him towards the ice. Hans understood
right away what was the matter, snatched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
a rope and ran towards the lake, and in
no time he stood by the hole. He threw
the rope to Viggo, who had begun to grow
stiff from the icy bath, and pulled him out.</p>

<p>Viggo ran as fast as he could to the
cottage of Hans, and when he reached the
door he had an armor of shining ice over
his whole body. When the Grenadier
pulled off his trousers they could stand by
themselves on the floor; they were frozen
stiff.</p>

<p>Viggo, of course, had to change from top
to toe, and what should he put on? Hans
went to his old chest and came back with
his uniform. Viggo looked rather queer,
the yellow knee trousers reached to his
ankles, and the red coat with yellow cuffs
and lapels hung on him like a bag. But
he was wearing a real uniform! Hans
looked at him. "Well," he said, "I won't
say much about the fit of the clothes, but
who knows you may wear a better looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
uniform some day. The heart is of the
right kind, and the nose&mdash;well it is doing
better."</p>

<h3><a name="bikku" id="bikku">Bikku Matti</a></h3>


<div><img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-o.jpg"
width="73" height="74" alt="O" />
</div><p><span class="dropletter">O</span><span class="smcap">n</span> a wooded hillside stood a little
cabin. It had but one window
and this was so small that, when
the round, fair, curly head of a little boy
appeared in it, the whole window was
filled. Some years ago there had been a
brick chimney and the walls had been
painted red. At that time the cabin and
a little potato field were fenced in neatly.
But now it all looked poor, very poor. The
smoke escaped through a hole in the turf
roof and the fence had fallen to pieces
long ago. In this place lived an old blind
soldier and his wife. They could not work
in the field to make their living; but the
old man earned a little money by tying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
nets; the old woman made a few brooms;
the church gave them each year three barrels
of rye for bread, and thus they managed
to live.</p>

<p>Four or five years ago a young and
hard-working couple lived with the old
people. Then they all had enough and to
spare. But one Sunday morning, the large
church boat that carried the people of the
parish to church was overturned by a
sudden squall, and both the young man
and his wife, with many others, were lost
in the waves. The old people had stayed
at home that day, the old man because he
was blind and his wife in order to take
care of a little baby.</p>

<p>So the old couple remained there with
their sorrow, their poverty and a little
grandchild. For the young couple had
left a little boy whose name was Matti;
because he was so little they called him
Bikku Matti. Those who don't understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Finnish will have to guess what the name
means.</p>

<p>Bikku had cheeks as red and round as
an apple, clear, blue eyes and hair as
yellow as gold, the only gold to be found
in the cabin. It was Bikku's round face
which often filled the cottage window when
anything passed on the road.</p>

<p>If you happen to come that way in
Summer, you will see a gate across the
road close to the cottage. You will have
to stop your carriage, unless some one
comes to open the gate.</p>

<p>But just wait a little, Bikku Matti will
soon be there. There he is in the cabin
door. How he runs to reach the gate
in time, with his golden hair streaming
in the wind. Now he is at the gate. If
you have a penny, throw it to him, he
rather expects it; but let it be a shiny
one&mdash;he does not know the value of money
and a penny, if bright and new, gives him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
as much pleasure as a silver coin. But
take care not to throw your coin on the
road before the horse and carriage have
passed the gate; Bikku Matti has but
little sense yet, and if he sees the bright
penny in the road, he is likely to throw
himself over it, allowing the gate to shut
right in front of your horse.</p>

<p>On week-days Bikku Matti had only
coarse bread and herring to eat, but on
Sundays he had potatoes and sour milk.
Still, on such food he throve and grew
rounder and rounder as the years went
by. He could not read much&mdash;some prayers
and the ten commandments was
about all.</p>

<p>But then Matti could do other things.
He could stand on his head and turn somersaults
where the grass was soft. He could
skip stones over the smooth lake, while
the grandmother was washing his shirt.
He could drive a horse on the main road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and ride the neighbor's horse to the watering
trough, if someone walked beside him.
He could tell the tracks of the blue-jay
from those of the crow on the new-fallen
snow, and wolf tracks he knew well. He
could carve a boat or a sled out of chips
of wood and could make horses and cows
of pine cones with small twigs for legs.
But, although Bikku possessed all these
powers (and they were many for a small
boy like Bikku), there were some necessary
things he did not possess&mdash;he had no
trousers. This may seem very strange to
you, but it was after all not so strange.
His grandparents were very poor, and then
it was customary in that neighborhood for
little boys to go about in plain cotton slips
as Bikku did. But this was only on week-days;
on Sundays the other boys were
dressed in blouses and trousers. It was
only Bikku who neither Sunday nor Monday
wore anything but the little slip. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
for a long time he did not know that
trousers were a necessary piece of garment
for a little boy. But see what happened.</p>

<p>One Sunday morning when the whole
parish were to meet at the beach to go to
church, Bikku declared that he was going
too. "That will never do, dear child,"
said Grandmother.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Bikku Matti.</p>

<p>"You have no trousers." Bikku became
very serious.</p>

<p>"I might have an old skirt to lend you,"
said Grandmother, "but then everybody
would take you for a girl."</p>

<p>"But I am not a girl, I am a man," said
Bikku Matti.</p>

<p>"Of course you are," said Grandmother.
"A man is a man, be he no larger than a
thumb. Stay nicely at home, Bikku dear."
And Bikku remained at home that time.</p>

<p>But soon after that there was to be a Fair
in the valley, a Horse Fair, and Bikku loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
horses better than anything else in the
world. He knew they would be there&mdash;black,
white and brown ones. And there
would be a Punch and Judy show, a merry-go-round,
and many more wonderful things.
Bikku Matti had heard the boys tell great
tales about all these things, and now Bikku
said that he must go to the Fair.</p>

<p>"It won't do, dear child," said Grandmother
again.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Bikku Matti.</p>

<p>"There will be many people there, my
dear, and you cannot go without trousers."</p>

<p>Bikku Matti struggled with himself a
while, and Punch and Judy danced before
his eyes. At last he said, "If Grandmother
would lend me her skirt?"</p>

<p>"Here it is," said Grandmother, and
laughed to herself when the little boy
stumbled on the kitchen floor in the skirt.
"But you look like a girl," she said.</p>

<p>"If I look like a girl, I won't go," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Bikku Matti. "I am no girl, I am a man."</p>

<p>"Well, you do look like a girl," said
Grandmother, "but you might tell everybody
whom you meet that you are a man."</p>

<p>"That's what I will do," thought Bikku
Matti, and so he started off.</p>

<p>On the road he met a strange gentleman
who stopped and said, "Little girl, can
you tell me the way to the Fair?"</p>

<p>"I am no girl, I am a man," said Bikku
Matti.</p>

<p>"You don't look like a man," said the
stranger.</p>

<p>Bikku Matti made no answer, but when
he reached the Fair he called out so that
all could hear him, "I only look like a
girl, but I am a man."</p>

<p>Men and women laughed out loud. Boys
and girls gathered about Bikku Matti,
clapped their hands and cried, "Oh, look
at little Mary, where did you get your
pretty clothes?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's Grandmother's skirt, and not
mine," said Bikku Matti. "I am no Mary,
I am Matti, don't you see?"</p>

<p>Then the largest and naughtiest of the
boys took Bikku Matti on his back, carried
him to the Punch and Judy show and cried
out, "Come and see a penny-lad! Come
and see my man in a petticoat!"</p>

<p>Bikku Matti grew angry and pulled the
boy's hair with all his might. "It is not
my skirt, it is Grandmother's skirt!" he
cried and he began to weep.</p>

<p>But the naughty boy kept on. "Come
and see this man in a skirt."</p>

<p>And in this way he ran around the whole
Fair grounds, the boy calling, Bikku pulling
his hair and crying. Never had Bikku
had such a ride. He cried, he screamed, he
scratched, he bit, and when at last he got
loose, he ran as fast as he could, but he
stumbled in the skirt, crawled up again,
stumbled, got up again and ran on until he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
reached Grandfather's cabin all out of
breath and sobbing.</p>

<p>"Take off the skirt!" he cried. "I
won't have any skirt, I am a man!"</p>

<p>"Don't cry, Bikku dear," said his
grandmother, trying to comfort him.
"When you grow old, you will show them
that you are a man as good as any."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Grandfather, "and next
time I will lend you my trousers."</p>

<p>They loved Bikku more than anything
else in the world, these old grandparents,
they would have given him gold embroidered
velvet trousers, if it had been in
their power. Now Grandmother gave him
a large piece of bread and butter, and
Bikku Matti sat in the corner eating it
while the tears dried on his cheek.</p>

<p>Some time after this there was great
excitement in the valley. The road was
one cloud of dust, from all the driving and
running. A gentleman of much importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
was expected to come through the valley.
It was even said that the gentleman was
next to the King himself. All the people
came to see him and strange things were
told about him. "He drives in a golden
carriage," said some. "With twelve horses
before it. He is dressed from top to toe
in silver and velvet," said others. But
the children had their own thoughts about
him. They imagined that the high gentleman
carried a big sack on his back filled
with silver coins and candy sticks, which
he threw out among them.</p>

<p>Bikku Matti also heard about it and this
time he had to be by the roadside with the
other children, there was no help for that.</p>

<p>"But what about your clothes?" said
Grandfather, smiling. "Perhaps you are
to borrow Grandmother's skirt?"</p>

<p>"I won't have any skirt!" cried Bikku
Matti, and turned red to the roots of his
hair when he remembered all that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
suffered because of that skirt. "No, never
in the world will I wear a skirt again. I
want Grandfather's trousers."</p>

<p>"Well, little one, come with me to the
garret and we will see how well the trousers
fit you," said Grandfather. And now Bikku
Matti was happy. He climbed up the garret
ladder like a cat, so fast that Grandfather
could not keep up with him. Then
they came to the big painted chest farthest
off in the corner.</p>

<p>Of this chest Bikku stood in great awe,
but he had only had glimpses into it once
or twice. Now it was opened, and the
first thing that lay there glittering before
him was a large sword in its gleaming
sheath. "O, Grandfather, I want that,"
he cried.</p>

<p>"Oh you do?" said Grandfather.
"Hold the sword till I get the uniform out
of the chest."</p>

<p>Bikku Matti took the sword; it was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
heavy that he could hardly lift it. Old
Grandfather stroked his cheek. "When
you become a man," he said, "perhaps you
may carry a sword too, and be allowed to
fight for your country. Do you want to
do that Bikku?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Bikku, straightening
himself. "I shall cut the heads off all of
them!"</p>

<p>"Oh now, that depends upon whom it is
you will fight."</p>

<p>"Yes," thought Bikku, "I shall cut the
heads off all the wolves and hawks, and
thistles and of all those who will harm
Grandfather and Grandmother, and of all
those who call me a girl."</p>

<p>"Well, well Bikku, take care, don't be
too cruel. Here are the trousers. You
need the coat too, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes, Grandfather, and the sword, and
the cap too."</p>

<p>"Here you have it all, Bikku, but you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
must promise not to go farther than the
gate." And Bikku promised.</p>

<p>Just as they came down from the garret
they heard the sheriff driving on the road
calling and shouting to the people to get
out of the road, that the high gentleman
was coming soon. There was a great deal
of hurry and flurry on the road as well as
in the little kitchen.</p>

<p>Grandfather's trousers were put on
Bikku Matti. They were gray with light
blue stripes along the sides and so wide
and long that Bikku could easily have
hidden himself in one of the trouser legs.
It looked very discouraging, but on they
must go. From below about half the length
of the trousers was rolled up and fastened
with pins, and from above they were
hitched up and tied with a kerchief under
Bikku's arms.</p>

<p>There was just as much difficulty with
the coat. When it was on the little fellow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the sleeves and coat tails swept the floor.</p>

<p>"No, this will not do," said Grandmother,
and she rolled up the sleeves and
coat tails and fastened them with pins.
Bikku was waiting impatiently.</p>

<p>The tall soldier cap was then placed on
his head, but it would have fallen down
over his little head and neck clear to the
shoulders, if it had not been filled with
hay. At last they tied the heavy sword on
Bikku's back and the little knight was
ready.</p>

<p>There never was a hero returning from
a victory half so proud as was Bikku in
his first pair of trousers. The little body
was lost in the big uniform, only the
blue, honest eyes, the red cheeks and the
important little pug-nose could be seen
between the collar and the cap. The brave
knight started off with the sword scraping
the ground. But soon the pins began to
fall out, the cap nearly upset, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
looked as if our soldier would surely fall
at each step he took. The old people had
not laughed so heartily for a long time.</p>

<p>Grandfather, who could hear but not see
the outfit, swung the little boy about, kissed
the little nose that stuck out and said,
"God bless you little Bikku, may no lad
worse than you wear our country's uniform.
Now take care to salute when the
great gentleman comes&mdash;so." And then
he taught Bikku to stand straight as a
stick with serious face, left arm stretched
straight down, right hand at the forehead.</p>

<p>"Yes, Grandfather," said Bikku, who
was always willing to learn. Bikku had
just arrived at the gate when a dust cloud
was seen on the road and the great gentleman
came driving. Now he was quite
near, oh, how fast he came! Suddenly the
driver called, "Whoa!" and again, "Open
that gate."</p>

<p>Now this is what happened. The sheriff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
himself was standing at the gate to see
that everything should go off right. He
was to give the command and his assistant
was to open it. But when the carriage
approached with lightning speed, the sheriff
wanted to make a deep bow. In doing so
he fell, and there he lay sprawling in the
ditch by the road. His assistant waited
for the word of command, and when he
saw his superior officer fall, he became so
confused that he could not think of opening
the gate. Therefore the gate remained
shut right before the nose of the high
gentleman. The carriage had stopped and
now the gentleman looked out surprised to
see what was the matter, while the driver
kept on calling, "Open the gate!"</p>

<p>Then Bikku Matti stepped up, though
with much difficulty, opened the gate and
saluted exactly as Grandfather had taught
him. The driver whipped up the horses,
the carriage started, but the gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
called, "Stop!" and the carriage stopped
a second time.</p>

<p>"Who are you, little one in my regiment's
uniform?" called out the high
gentleman, and laughed so heartily that the
carriage shook.</p>

<p>Bikku Matti did not understand anything
of this and did only what Grandfather
had told him to, saluted again as straight
and serious as could be. This amused the
high gentleman still more, and he asked
the people who stood near about the
parents of the little boy.</p>

<p>The sheriff, who by this time had crept
out of the ditch, came hurriedly forward
to tell that the little boy was an orphan
and lived with his grandfather, an old
blind soldier named Hugh.</p>

<p>What was the surprise of all, when the
gentleman stepped out of his carriage, took
Bikku by the hand and walked with him
straight to the little cabin. And what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
excitement in the little hut! Grandmother
could say nothing when the stranger
entered, but stood there open-mouthed.
Grandfather, because he saw nothing, had
more courage and pointed politely in the
direction where he knew the bench was.</p>

<p>"God's blessings on you my friends,"
said the stranger and shook hands with the
old people. "It seems to me I recognize
you, old comrade," he continued, while he
looked searchingly at Grandfather. "Are
you not Hugh No. 39 of my old regiment?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Captain," answered Grandfather
in great surprise, for he recognized the
voice.</p>

<p>"God be praised, that at last I have
found you. Do you think I could forget
you, who saved my life? You, who carried
me on your back across the stream while
the bullets sang about your ears, and the
enemies were all about? If you have forgotten
it, do you think I ever should forget<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
it? After the war was over, I looked for
you and inquired for you everywhere, but
without success, and at last I thought you
were dead. But now I have found you,
and now I may repay you a little by
looking after you and yours in your old
age. And what a fine boy you have!"</p>

<p>The gentleman caught Bikku Matti in
his arms, lifted him high up and kissed
him so heartily that the hat fell off, the
sword rattled and the rest of Grandmother's
pins fell out of the coat and the
trousers.</p>

<p>"No, no, let me alone," said Bikku.
"Now you have made me drop the cap,
and Grandfather will be angry."</p>

<p>"Dear sir," said Grandmother, quite
ashamed of Bikku, "be so kind as not to
mind how the boy talks; he is not used to
being with people."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about the boy's talk, he
is right in guarding the soldier's cap.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Listen, Bikku, do you want to become a
soldier like your Grandfather?" said the
gentleman.</p>

<p>"Grandfather says it depends upon
whom I am to fight," said Bikku.</p>

<p>"That is right," said the gentleman,
"and you certainly are not lacking in
courage."</p>

<p>"That, Captain, is because he wears
trousers for the first time to-day, and that
gives courage."</p>

<p>"Rather say it is the old uniform which
gives courage," said the General (for now
he was a general). "Much gunpowder and
much honor are hidden in that old uniform
and the memories of it pass from generation
to generation. But this is a new age
and the boy may live to serve his country
in many ways. Are you strong little
man?"</p>

<p>Bikku did not answer but held out his
arm and showed his muscles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said the General, "I see you
will be as strong as a bear when you are
a little older. Will you go with me and eat
soft bread and drink milk every day, and
cakes and candy you may have too, if you
are good?"</p>

<p>"And shall I have a horse to ride on?"
asked Bikku.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," said the General.</p>

<p>Bikku thought it over a while, his little
blue eyes flew from the stranger to Grandfather,
from Grandfather to Grandmother,
and back to the stranger again. At last he
crept upon the old woman's knee and said,
"I will stay with Grandfather and
Grandmother."</p>

<p>"But dear Bikku," said the old soldier,
with tears in his eyes, "Grandfather gives
you only hard bread, water and herring.
Don't you hear that gentleman offers you
soft bread, milk and other good things,
and a horse to ride?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want to stay with Grandfather, I
won't leave Grandfather," cried Bikku,
hardly able to keep the tears away.</p>

<p>"You are right," said the General and
stroked Bikku's round cheek, "stay with
your Grandfather, and none of you shall
suffer want, and when you grow to be a
man, come to me, if I am still living. You
shall have fields to plow and forests to
hew. But whatever work you do, it is all
the same, you will be an honest and loyal
son of your country. Will you not,
Bikku?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the boy standing straight
and tall.</p>

<p>"God bless you child," said Grandfather
and Grandmother, moved to tears. "And
God bless our beloved country, and may he
give it many loyal sons like you, little
Bikku. Honor thy father and thy mother
that thy days may be long upon the land
which the Lord thy God giveth thee."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's written in my primer," said
Bikku Matti softly.</p>

<p>"Yes, but it must be written in our
hearts also," said the general, and once
more he kissed the boy.</p>
